--- abstract

This memo contains the thoughts and recountings of events that
transpired during and after the release of information about the
NSA by Edward Snowden.  There are three perspectives: that of
a security area director of the IETF, a human rights expert, and
of someone who was involved with sifting through the information
to responsibly inform the public.  The purpose of this memo is
to provide some historical perspective, while at the same time
offering a view as to what security challenges the technical
community should consider.

Introduction

IETF and Internet Technical community reaction - Stephen
=======

Disclaimer (better elsewhere in document): the text below provides the author's
perspective and of course is limited and likely omits important things.

In 2013, the IETF and, more broadly, the Internet technical, security and
privacy research communities, were surprised by the surveillance and attack
efforts exposed by the Snowden revelations.  {{timeline}} While the
potential for such was known, it was the scale and pervasiveness of the
activities disclosed that was alarming and, I think it fair to say, quite
annoying, for very many Internet engineers.

As for the IETF's reaction, informal meetings during the July 2013 IETF meeting
in Berlin indicated that IETF participants considered that these revelations
showed that we needed to do more to improve the security and privacy properties
of IETF protocols, and to help ensure deployments made better use of the
security and privacy mechanisms that already existed. In August, the IETF setup
a new mailing list {{perpass}} that ended up being a useful venue for triaging
proposals for work on these topics. At the November 2013 IETF meeting, there
was a lively and very well attended plenary session {{plenary-video}} on
"hardening the Internet" against such attacks, followed by a "birds of a
feather" {{BoF-session}} devoted to more detailed discussion of possible
actions in terms of new working groups, protcols and best-current-practice
(BCP) documents that could help improve matters.  This was followed in
February/March 2014 by a joint IAB/W3C workshop on "strengthening the Internet
against pervasive monitoring" {{STRINT}} in London attended by 150 engineers
(still the only IAB workshop in my experience where we needed to setup a
wait-list for people who wanted to attend after capacity for the venue was
reached:-). The workshop report was eventually published as {{?RFC7687}} in
2015, but in the meantime work proceeeded on a best-current-practice document
codifying that the IETF community considered that "pervasive monitoring is an
attack" {{?RFC7258}} (aka BCP188). The IETF last-call discussion for that short
document included more than 1000 emails - while there was broad agreement on
the overall message, a number of IETF participants considered enshrining that
message in the RFC series and IETF processes was controversial, but in any case
the BCP was published in May 2014. The key statement on which rough consensus
was reached is in the abstract of RFC7258 and says "Pervasive monitoring is a
technical attack that should be mitigated in the design of IETF protocols,
where possible." That document has since been referenced {{refs-to-7258}} by
many IETF working groups and RFCs as justifying additional work on security and
privacy. Throughout this period and beyond, the repercussions of the Snowden
revelations was also a major and ongoing agenda item for both of the IETF's
main technical management bodies - the IAB and the IESG (on which the author of
this section served at the time).

So far, I've really only described the processes with which the IETF dealt with
the attacks, but there was of course also much technical work started by IETF
participants that was at least partly motivated by the Snowden revelations.

In November 2013 a working group was established to document better practices
for using TLS in applications {{UTA}} so that deployments would be less at risk
in the face of some of the attacks related to stripping TLS or having
appliations mis-use TLS APIs or parameters.  Similar work was done to update
recommendations for use of cryptography in other protocols in the {{CURDLE}}
working group later.  The CURDLE working group was to an extent created to
enable use of a set of new elliptic curves that had been documented by the IRTF
crypto forum research group. {{CFRG}} That work in turn had been partly
motivated by (perhaps ultimately unfounded) concerns about elliptic curves
defined in NIST standards, following the dual-ec debacle {{dual-ec}} where a
NIST random number generator had been deliberately engineered to produce output
that could be vulnerable to NSA attack.

Work to develop a new version of TLS was started in 2014, mainly due to
concerns that TLSv1.2 and earlier version implementations had been shown to be
vulnerable to a range of attacks over the years. The work to develop TLSv1.3
{{?RFC8446}} also however aimed to encrypt more of the handshake so as to
expose less information to network observers - a fairly direct result of the
Snowden relevations.  Work to further improve TLS in this respect continues
today using the so-called encrypted client hello (ECH) {{?I-D.ietf-tls-esni}}
mechanism to remove one of the last privacy leaks present in current TLS.

Work on ECH was enabled by significant developments to encrypt DNS traffic,
using DoT {{?RFC7858}} or DoH {{?RFC8484}} which also started as a result of
the Snowden relevations. Prior to that, privacy hadn't really been considered
when it came to DNS data or (more importantly) the act of accessing DNS data.
The trend towards encrypting DNS traffic represents a significant change for
the Internet, both in terms of reducing cleartext, but also in terms of moving
points-of-control. The latter aspect was, and remains, controversial, but the
IETF did it's job of defining new protocols that can enable better DNS privacy.
Work on HTTP version 2 {{?RFC7540}} and QUIC {{?RFC9000}} further demonstrates
the trend in the IETF towards always-encrypting protocols as the new norm, at
least at and above the transport layer.

Of course, not all these initiatives bore fruit, for example attempts to define
a new MPLS encryption mechanism {{?I-D.farrelll-mpls-opportunistic-encrypt}}
foundered due to a lack of interest and the existence of the already deployed
IEEE MACSEC scheme. But there has been a fairly clear trend towards trying to
remove cleartext from the Internet as a precursor to providing better privacy
when considering network observers as attackers.

The IETF of course, forms only one part of the broader Internet technical
community, and there were many non-IETF activities triggered by the Snowden
revelations, a number of which also eventually resulted in new IETF work to
standardise better security and privacy mechanisms developed elsewhere.

In 2013, the web was largely unencrypted despite HTTPS being relatively
usable and that was partly due to problems using the WebPKI at scale. The
LetsEncrypt {{LE}} initiatve was established in 2015 to try move the web
towards being fully encryted and has been extremely successful in helping
achieve that goal.  Subsequently, the automation protocols developed for
LetsEncrypt were standardised in the IETF's ACME {{ACME}} working group.

In 2013, most email transport between mail servers was cleartext,
directly enabling some of the attacks documented in the Snowden documents.
Significant effort by major mail services and MTA software developers since
then have resulted in more than 90% of email being encrypted between mail
servers and various IETF protocols have been defined in order to improve that
situation, e.g., MTA-STS. {{?rfc8461}}

Lastly, MAC addressees have historically been long-term fixed values visble to
local networks (and beyond), which enabled some tracking attacks that were
documented in the Snowden documents. {{Toronto}} The IEEE 802
standards group recognised this weakness and started work on MAC address
randomisation that in turn lead to the IETF's {{MADINAS}} working group that
aims to ensure randomised MAC addresses can be used on the Internet without
causing unintentional harm.

In summary, the significantly large volume of technical work pursued in the
IETF and elsewhere as a result of the Snowden revelations has focussed on two
main things: decreasing the amount of plaintext that remains visible to network
observers and secondly reducing the number of long-term identifiers that enable
unexpected identification or re-identification of devices or users. This work
is not by any means complete, nor is deployment universal, but significant
progress has been made and the work continues even if the level of annoyance
at the attack has faded somewhat over time.

One should also note that there has been push-back against these improvements
in security and privacy and the changes they cause for deployments. That has
come from more or less two camps - those on whom these improvements force
change tend to react badly, but later figure out how to adjust. The second camp
being those who seemingly prefer not to strenghten security so as to for
example continue to achieve what they call "visibility" even in the face of the
many engineers who correctly argue that such an anti-encryption approach
inevitably leads to worse security overall. The recurring nature of this kind
of push-back is nicely illustrated by {{?RFC1984}}. That informational document
was published in 1996 as an IETF response to an early iteration of the
perennial "encryption is bad" argument. In 2015, the unmodified 1996 text was
upgraded to a best-current-practice (BCP200) as the underlying arguments have
not, and will not, change.

Looking back on all the above from a 2023 vantage point, I think one can say
that, as a community of Internet engineers, we got a lot right, but that today
there's way more that needs to be done to better protect the security and
privacy of people who use the Internet. In particular, we (the technical
community) haven't done nearly as good a job at countering surveillance
capitalism which has exploded in the last decade. In part, that's because many
of the problems are outside of the scope of bodies such as the IETF, for
example, intrusive back-end sharing of people's data for advertising purposes
can't really be addressed via Internet protocols.  However, I also think it's
likely the case that the real level of annoyance felt with respect to the
Snowden revelations seems (in general) to not be felt nearly as much when it
comes to the legal but privacy-invasive activities of major employers of
Internet engineers. It's noteworthy that RFC7258 doesn't consider that bad
actors are limited to governments and personally, I think many advertising
industry schemes for collecting data are egregious examples of pervasive
monitoring and hence ought also be considered an attack on the Internet that
ought be mitigated where possible.  However, the Internet technical community
clearly hasn't acted in that way over the last decade.

Perhaps that indicates that Internet engineers and the bodies in which they
congregate need to place much more emphasis on standards for ethical behaviour
than has been the case for the first half-century of the Internet.  And while
it would be good to see the current leaders of Internet bodies work to make
progress in that regard, at the time of writing, it seems more likely that
Government regulators will be the ones to try force better behaviour. That of
course comes with a significant risk of having regulations that stymie the kind
of permissionless innovation that characterised many earlier Internet
successes.

So while we got a lot right in our reaction to Snowden's revelations,
currently, we have a "worse" Internet.  Nonetheless, I do still hope to see a
sea-change there though, as the importance of real Internet security and
privacy for people becomes utterly obvious to all, even the most hard core
capitalists and government signals intelligence agencies, but that's perhaps
because I'm just an optimist:-)
